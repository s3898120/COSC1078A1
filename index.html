					<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
				</div>

				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p>My interest in IT is hardware such as building computers, networking such as setting up routers, servers, consulting with other people, My interest in IT started when I was in primary school during year 6. There was a particular person who sparked my interest, which was the IT repair man. I started to have a interest in computers since i was in primary school. During 2010, i noticed that my primary school had new lenovo computers being installed throughout each classrooms. During that time, Windows 7 was a brand new operating system. When i first used the new computers, i was fascinated of how they functioned, the software and hardware used in the computers. During that period at home i had a desktop computer, it wasn't as good as the one at school, such as having windows xp compared to windows 7, intel pentium comapared to intel i5 and 1gb of ram compared to 4gb. </p>

				<h1>Ideal Job</h1>
				<p> My ideal job would be something related to IT as i am studying a 3 year course on Bachelor of IT. The ideal job would be consulting as consulting involves talking to people. The reason why talking to people is important is because there needs to be an interaction between with human beings as being infront of a computer is not very good as you are looking at a machine, which doesnt have any feelings or emotions.

					<h2>16 Personalities Test</h2>
					<p>The 16 Personalities test also known as the Myer Briggs Test that i have conducted, shows that i am, introverted, which is correct, as i am a quiet person who likes to be alone. With the others such as obeservant, thinking, judging, and turbulent, i don't think i agreee with it as i am not a very judging person, i dont judge a book by its front cover, nor that i am a unstable person..</p>
					<h3>Strengths</h3>

					<h3>Weaknesses</h3>

					<h3>Team Composition</h3>
					<p>The team composition resulted from this test shows that i am a very quiet person, who doesn't like to involve in social interactions, being individualistic. From what i can gather, this is true as i like to go away to a quiet area and do activties alone..</p>

				<h1>Project Idea</h1>
			</div>

			<div class="sectionContent">
				<article>
					<h2>Overview</h2>
					<p>For my project idea that i have developed, is an app that when other people text/call you, sends a replied message back letting them know that you're driving at the moment. For this project intend this proposed user type will be young people aged between 18-24 years old as they will typically living a home with parents. Parents often call to ask where their child is, however they could be behind the wheel unable to pickup the phone by all means. This can result in a worrying condition as the parents try to call many times but they don’t pick up the phone or it goes into voicemail..</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Motivation</h2>
					<p>The motivation of this idea started when my phone kept ringing while I am driving my car. As a probationary driver, I am not allowed use any hands free device nor use anything that can pick up my phone whilst driving. Full licensed drivers on the other hand can use the hands free device such as the Bluetooth or use their car radio to pick up the phone. Therefore I wanted to create an app that allows the phone to send out a message or voicemail that lets incoming calls know that I am driving the car. This can be useful as my parents call me wondering where I am and me unable to tell them because I am driving.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Description</h2>
					<p> For this app to be developed, I intend to use react native by Facebook as I find it is a good open sourced developer for amateurs. An app name that I would call this app is Deworrying as the name suggests for parents to stop worrying where their child is at the moment. I intend to make the app run on ios 11 or later android 9 or later. As this is a medium to moderate memory using app, I would suggest this app to use 512mb or ram and 1gb of storage in order to the app to run. This app would use java frame work as well.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
					<p>The tools and technologies required to build this app for the amateur app developer which fits into my category is the “react native” by Facebook. The reason why I have chosen it is because firstly it is an open source development tool which means any body can use it without paying for the usage. Secondly react native uses javascript library for building user interfaces. This is also good, as I am currently learning further programming which teaches about javascript and java development which means that I will already have knowledge of it. Lastly react native is a multiuse frame work which supports ios, android, windows which is good as many phones uses that..</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Skills Required</h2>
					<p>The skills required to build this app that I am proposing is software development. Software development requires me to use mathematical knowledge, problem solving skills, the knowledge of the different types of languages, such as apple, android, linux, knowing how to use my time wisely, being able to pay attention to any bugs in the software. The feasibility of finding these skills are at the bare minimum at the moment for me as I am still in the learning phase of these. For me to learn this, it would take me time to study using such as Youtube or other materials out there as many other people have done in the past. The hardware is already there as people are using smart phones. .</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Outcome</h2>
					<p>If this project is successful it will allow myself and hundreds of probational drivers to send a automated message to let other people know that they are driving at the moment. It will also solve the temptation of the phone ringing, letting young drivers touch their phone which could cause a collision or a fatal incident. The original problem will be solved as any calls are diverted to this app and it will send out a message to who ever calls through letting them know that they are driving. This will have a detrimental impact as it is a breakthrough technology.</p>
